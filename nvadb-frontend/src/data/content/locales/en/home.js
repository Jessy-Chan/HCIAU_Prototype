    content:"The National Art Galleryâ€™s exhibition this time will take the audience to view its permanent collection from the context of Southeast, highlighting the validity, the interpretation and the fiction, as well as tracing athe essence of social and cultural structures that form the tapestry of southeastern in the region. Southeast here refers to the countries within the topology of Southeast Asia. Nusa in Malay maybe translated as motherland or homeland in English. In constructing the narrative, eight segments have been created. Exploring Stories and Connecting World will look from the point of view of historiography, international relations and economic activities that have taken place. Searching the Essence and things under Symbols, Fonts/ Language, Coding and Charm/ Divination will look from the point of view of understanding a perspective and decoding symbols, language through writing, codes, amulets and rituals. Mobility, Diaspora, Longing and Vibe the Verve, Escalating Geist will look at the question of identity within the superdiversity which had been created by migration, and at monuments and works of art that give voice or shape to the spirit. Solicitude Culture and Sowing Inner Characteristic will look from the point of view of lifestyle and national unity as well as visual language and cultural symbols. All in all, the exhibition showcases a selection of works from the National Collection that respond to the narratives of the featured segments from the viewpoints of history and mythology, questions and quests of identity, and ideas and proposals that support the notion Southeast that this exhibition tries to exemplify."
